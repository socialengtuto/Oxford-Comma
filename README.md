# Oxford-Comma
The opinion on whether the Oxford comma should be used is divided. Although it is called Oxford comma, it is relatively less used in British English than in American English. A majority of style guides in American English mandate use of the serial comma including the U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual.  Some British style guides require it, including The Oxford Style Manual.

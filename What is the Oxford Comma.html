Oxford Comma?</a></u></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><b>The Oxford
Comma,</b> also called a serial comma or series comma, is a comma
placed immediately before the coordinating conjunction (usually and
or or) in a series of three or more things. For example, a list of
three beverages might be punctuated either as “tea, coffee, and
lemonade” (with the Oxford Comma), or as “tea, coffee and lemonade”
(without the Oxford Comma).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">The opinion on
whether the Oxford comma should be used is divided. Although it is
called Oxford comma, it is relatively less used in British English
than in American English. A majority of style guides in American
English mandate use of the serial comma including the U.S.
Government Printing Office Style Manual. Some British style guides
require it, including The Oxford Style Manual.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><b>Whether
the</b> <font color="#0563C1"><u><a href=
"http://engtuto.com/oxford-comma">Oxford Comma</a></u></font>
<b>should be used.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">-Many writer
and editors are for its use.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><b>Reason: It
resolves ambiguity.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">-Many writers
and editors are against its use.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><b>Reason: It
creates ambiguity.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">How in some
cases the oxford comma brings in ambiguity, and also how in an many
cases it resolves the ambiguity surrounding a statement.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">Examples:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><b>Resolving
Ambiguity</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">To my friends,
John and Ricky.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">Some people may
interpret the above mentioned statement as ” John and Ricky are the
friends of the writer, and he is addressing to them.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">Some people may
interpret the above mentioned statement as “the writer is
addressing to his friends along with John and Ricky”.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">If we place a
comma right after JOHN, all ambiguity shall disappear.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">To my friends,
John, and Ricky.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">It is now clear
that the writer is addressing to his friends along with John and
Ricky.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><b>Creating
Ambiguity</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">To my friend,
John, and Ricky</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">Some people may
interpret the above mentioned statement as “the writer is
addressing to his friend John along with someone called Ricky
.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">Some people may
interpret the above mentioned statement as “the writer is
addressing to his friend along with two other people named John and
Ricky .”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">So, in order to
avoid any ambiguity, some legends advocate to construct the
statements like:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">To Ricky, John,
and my friends.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><i>Unless
you’re writing for a particular publication or drafting an essay
for school, whether or not you use the Oxford comma is generally up
to you. However, omitting it can sometimes cause some strange
misunderstandings.<br></i><br>
<br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><b>Who’s
against and for its Use</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">Generally, the
Oxford comma has been neglected mostly by newspapers , magazine and
tabloids, where strict character breaking points are required in
the restricted bounds of printed segments. There is no consistency
in its utilization or exclusion when taking a gander at authentic
writings (it's been utilized for a considerable length of time,
however individuals have likewise been discarding it for a
considerable length of time), yet today, its utilization is for the
most part more regular among American style guides than it is among
British ones. The Times and The Economist, for example, are both
against its utilization. Some outstanding American aides, for
example, The Chicago Manual of Style support it, however there are
remarkable exceptional cases, for example, the Associated Press
Stylebook. Others, for example, The Guardian, are more adaptable,
contending that it ought to be utilized just as a part of
circumstances when it is required to stay away from equivocalness.
Curiously, numerous dialects – including French, German and Italian
– don't utilize the Oxford comma by any means.</p>
